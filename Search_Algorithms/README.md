# Linear & Binary Search Algorithm Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive implementation of search algorithms designed for optimizing data retrieval in different data structures. This project demonstrates efficient searching techniques in both array-based and linked list data structures.

## Features
- Linear search implementation for arrays and linked lists
- Binary search implementation for sorted arrays
- Comparative performance analysis between search algorithms
- Comprehensive test coverage for all algorithms

## Technical Details
This project implements two fundamental search algorithms:

- **Linear Search**: Implemented for both array-based and linked list structures
  - Time Complexity: O(n)
  - Best for: Unsorted data or small datasets

- **Binary Search**: Implemented with recursive approach for sorted arrays
  - Time Complexity: O(log n)
  - Best for: Sorted datasets of medium to large size

## Implementation Structures
- `ASearch`: Array-based implementation featuring both linear and binary search
- `LSearch`: Linked list implementation featuring linear traversal search
